This project enables AI assistant clients like Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop to control Unreal Engine through natural language using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

> **This is a fork of [chongdashu/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp)** with additional Blueprint graph editing features. See [Modifications in this Fork](#-modifications-in-this-fork) below for what's changed. Tested only on **Unreal Engine 5.5.4** — see [Releases](../../releases).

## ⚠️ Experimental Status

This project is currently in an **EXPERIMENTAL** state. The API, functionality, and implementation details are subject to significant changes. While we encourage testing and feedback, please be aware that:

- Breaking changes may occur without notice
- Features may be incomplete or unstable
- Documentation may be outdated or missing
- Production use is not recommended at this time

## 🌟 Overview

The Unreal MCP integration provides comprehensive tools for controlling Unreal Engine through natural language:

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|-------------|
| **Actor Management** | • Create and delete actors (cubes, spheres, lights, cameras, etc.)<br>• Set actor transforms (position, rotation, scale)<br>• Query actor properties and find actors by name<br>• List all actors in the current level |
| **Blueprint Development** | • Create new Blueprint classes with custom components<br>• Add and configure components (mesh, camera, light, etc.)<br>• Set component properties and physics settings<br>• Compile Blueprints and spawn Blueprint actors<br>• Create input mappings for player controls |
| **Blueprint Node Graph** | • Add event nodes (BeginPlay, Tick, etc.)<br>• Create function call nodes and connect them<br>• Add variables with custom types and default values<br>• Create component and self references<br>• Find and manage nodes in the graph |
| **Editor Control** | • Focus viewport on specific actors or locations<br>• Control viewport camera orientation and distance |

All these capabilities are accessible through natural language commands via AI assistants, making it easy to automate and control Unreal Engine workflows.

## 🧩 Components

### Sample Project (MCPGameProject) `MCPGameProject`
- Based off the Blank Project, but with the UnrealMCP plugin added.

### Plugin (UnrealMCP) `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP`
- Native TCP server for MCP communication
- Integrates with Unreal Editor subsystems
- Implements actor manipulation tools
- Handles command execution and response handling

### Python MCP Server `Python/unreal_mcp_server.py`
- Implemented in `unreal_mcp_server.py`
- Manages TCP socket connections to the C++ plugin (port 55557)
- Handles command serialization and response parsing
- Provides error handling and connection management
- Loads and registers tool modules from the `tools` directory
- Uses the FastMCP library to implement the Model Context Protocol

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.5+ (this fork tested only on 5.5.4)
- Python 3.12+
- MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf)

### Sample project

For getting started quickly, feel free to use the starter project in `MCPGameProject`. This is a UE 5.5 Blank Starter Project with the `UnrealMCP.uplugin` already configured. 

1. **Prepare the project**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
2. **Build the project (including the plugin)**
   - Open solution (`.sln`)
   - Choose `Development Editor` as your target.
   - Build

### Plugin
Otherwise, if you want to use the plugin in your existing project:

1. **Copy the plugin to your project**
   - Copy `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP` to your project's Plugins folder

2. **Enable the plugin**
   - Edit > Plugins
   - Find "UnrealMCP" in Editor category
   - Enable the plugin
   - Restart editor when prompted

3. **Build the plugin**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
   - Open solution (`.sln)
   - Build with your target platform and output settings

### Python Server Setup

See [Python/README.md](Python/README.md) for detailed Python setup instructions, including:
- Setting up your Python environment
- Running the MCP server
- Using direct or server-based connections

### Configuring your MCP Client

Use the following JSON for your mcp configuration based on your MCP client.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path/to/the/folder/PYTHON>",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

An example is found in `mcp.json`

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.


## 🔧 Modifications in this Fork

This fork builds on the upstream [chongdashu/unreal-mcp](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp) project. Changes are focused on making Blueprint graph editing work beyond just the main EventGraph, plus a couple of reliability fixes.

**C++ Plugin (`MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP`)**
- **Target any Blueprint graph, not just EventGraph** — added `FUnrealMCPCommonUtils::FindGraph()` so node/connection commands can target a named function graph (e.g. a custom function called `Enable`) instead of only the main event graph.
- **Collapsed/composite ("folded") sub-graph support** — `FindGraph()` and `list_blueprint_graphs` now also search into collapsed/composite sub-graphs (`K2Node_Composite::BoundGraph`), nested arbitrarily deep, via a new `FUnrealMCPCommonUtils::GatherNestedGraphs()` helper.
- **New commands**: `list_blueprint_graphs`, `add_blueprint_variable_get_node`, `add_blueprint_variable_set_node`, `break_blueprint_pin_links`, `delete_blueprint_node`.
- **Material graph editing** — new `FUnrealMCPMaterialCommands` handler adds `create_material_expression`, `connect_material_expressions`, `connect_material_property`, `set_material_expression_property`, `set_material_property`, `compile_material`, so `UMaterialExpression` node graphs (e.g. custom render-target compositing materials) can be built/edited directly instead of by hand in the Material Editor.
- **`SetObjectProperty` extended** to support `FName`, struct properties (`FLinearColor`, `FVector2D`, `FVector`), and object/asset reference properties — needed for the Material commands above, and usable by any existing property-setting command.
- **Cross-component variable references** — `CreateVariableGetNode` / `CreateVariableSetNode` accept an optional `OwnerClass`, so a generated Get/Set node can reference a variable owned by another class (e.g. a sibling component) instead of only `self`.
- **Fixed a TCP response truncation bug** in `MCPServerRunnable.cpp` — `FSocket::Send()` isn't guaranteed to send the whole buffer in one call, so large responses (e.g. a full node-graph dump) could get silently cut off. Sending now loops until all bytes are confirmed sent.

**Python MCP Server (`Python/`)**
- Added an optional `graph_name` parameter to the relevant blueprint node tools (`add_blueprint_function_node`, `connect_blueprint_nodes`, `add_blueprint_get_component_node`, `add_blueprint_self_reference`, etc.) so callers can target a specific function graph. Defaults to the main EventGraph when omitted, preserving existing behavior. `graph_name` also accepts a folded/composite sub-graph name.
- New `tools/material_tools.py` registers the six Material graph tools listed above.

**Compatibility**
- Only verified against **Unreal Engine 5.5.4**. Other 5.5.x builds are likely fine but untested — see [Releases](../../releases) for the tested tag.
